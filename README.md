# Breast Cancer Prediction using TensorFlow/Keras

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and save a deep learning model for breast cancer prediction using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview

In this project, we use a custom classifier built with TensorFlow/Keras to predict breast cancer. The model is trained on a dataset containing features extracted from breast cancer images. We then save the trained model for future use.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cockles98/breast_cancer_prediction.git
   ```
   
2. Run the *train_model_&_save.py* script to train the model and save it, or run the *load_model_&_evaluate.py* script to evaluate and use the model.

3. Optionally, modify the `features` and `classes` variables in the *load_model_&_evaluate.py* script with your own test data to evaluate it.
