# Breast Cancer Prediction using TensorFlow/Keras

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and save a deep learning model for breast cancer prediction using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview

In this project, we use a custom classifier built with TensorFlow/Keras to predict breast cancer. The model is trained on a dataset containing features extracted from breast cancer images. We then save the trained model for future use.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cockles98/breast_cancer_prediction.git
   ```
   
2. Run the train_model.py script to train the model and save it:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. Optionally, modify the test_data and test_labels variables in the evaluate_model.py script with your own test data to evaluate it:

   ``` bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```
